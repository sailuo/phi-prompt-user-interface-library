# How to install the library #

First download the package, then extract the files under your Arduino Sketchbook/Libraries folder, so that the three files will be under c:/Arduino1.0/Sketchbooks/Libraries/phi\_prompt/ (Just example, your directory may be different)

Then download the phi\_interfaces library and install in in a similar folder such as: c:/Arduino1.0/Sketchbooks/Libraries/phi\_interfaces/

Then close all Arduino IDE windows.

Reopen Arduino IDE, open a sketchbook you want to use the phi\_buttons. Then choose under the Arduino IDE menu Sketch->Import library->phi\_prompt

The Arduino IDE automatically creates a line in the beginning of your sketchbook: #include <phi\_prompt.h>

For some sample code that needs phi\_big\_font or phi\_super\_font library, find the latest download here:

OK you're done!
