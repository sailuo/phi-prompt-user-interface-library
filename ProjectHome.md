This is the first ever open source user interface library for arduino that supports a user interface consisting of an LCD and buttons or keypads. Functions include interactive menus, long scrolling text areas, horizontal scrolling texts, input numbers and texts on various button and keypad layouts. Many contributed "hacks" are created by users of this library to adapt more hardware, such as shift register driven LCDs and serial LCDs. This library was originally developed for phi-2 shield.

Please download the phi\_buttons and phi\_prompt libraries and install them in arduino/sketches/libraries per instructions.

This project is open source. I make every effort to maintain it the best I can. Please support my effort by purchasing some of my arduino shields and gadgets here:
